# employee-manager
This was a school project that was designed for clients to keep organize their employees. HTML and bootstrap was utilized in the front end while NodeJs, Express, Handlebars, client-sessions were implemented in the backend. 
PostgreSQL was utilized to store the employee information, and MongoDB was used to manage the login accounts, the authentication, and login history as well.
